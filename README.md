# Retrieve Bullets Mod
This mod makes bullets retrievable from animals you killed with firearms.  
You can harvest new items, called "Damaged bullets" from the carcasses and then reforge them at the ammunition workshop.  
You receive these damaged bullets when you succesfully harvest a carcass, you shot. You get the bullets per kilogram of harvested meat, until you receive all the bullets you hit.
